# Emergency-ER-Game-Simulation
This is a simulaiton of the Emergency! boardgame which itself is a simulaiton of an Emergency Department at the hospital. I have recreated the game with a distribution starategy and used a hill climbing algorithm in order to find the best starting position

I was very lucky to have Prof Craig Froehle from University of Cincinnati,creator of Emergency! as a guest lecturer and gamemaster. In preparation of playing the game I created this simulation script in order to have the best ER at my disposal during the game. 

The goal of this game is to prepare the ER to welcome and take care of all of the different patients coming through in a day based on their acuity level. The performance is evlauated based on the net profit the ER makes during the day. You can find the rest of the rules in the linked pdf file.

Since no informaiton about the distribution of the different patients appart from the total number of patients throughout the day, I had to estimate it. This was not very representative of the true distribution used in game, and is actually much harder. The simulation is close enough that the solution provided by the soluiton worked very well during the actual game!
